This is the basic README.md for task 1


Timeline App
Â Basic HTML Skeleton
This document tells about the first stage of the "Timeline App" . Now, the application only has a basic HTML structure so, it is unstyled for now.

Features  :

index.html: Contains the core HTML elements for the app.

A <header> with the main title.

A <section id="timeline"> to hold future event entries.

An empty <div id="modal"> for pop-up functionality that will be added later.
