This is the basic README.md for task 1


Timeline App
Â Basic HTML Skeleton
This document tells about the first stage of the "Timeline App" . Now, the application only has a basic HTML structure so, it is unstyled for now.

Features  :

index.html: Contains the core HTML elements for the app.

A header tag with the main title.

A section tag with id="timeline"  to hold future event details.

An empty div tag with id="modal" for pop-up functionality that will be added later.
